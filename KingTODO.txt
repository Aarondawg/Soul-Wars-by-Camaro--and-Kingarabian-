In order
-Clean up my code.
-Review it, understand, ask(Write down questions)
-Check for any possible mishaps where a failsafe could be due (id think there should be some spots maybe)
-Start working on adding user preferences (what team you want to be(always red, always blue, last won, random) and decide a good way to handle how its done in our script)
-Go into a game and make a function that determines if you are in game (Very simple)

funciton ingame: boolean;
begin
  result := getcolor(A Certain X, Certain y ) = 555; just check for a color that dont chnage

-Whatever YOU want now :) now that my list is done for now, u have time for fun and make stufffzz
